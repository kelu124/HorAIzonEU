3. **Recommendations for Research Funding Organizations:**
   - Promote and support the responsible use of generative AI in research.
   - Review the use of generative AI in internal processes transparently and responsibly.
   - Request transparency from applicants on their use of generative AI.
   - Monitor and actively engage in the evolving generative AI landscape.

### Promotion of responsible use of genAI

The guidelines emphasize promoting and supporting the responsible use of generative AI in research. This includes designing funding instruments that encourage ethical and legal use of AI technologies, ensuring compliance with national and international legislation, and encouraging researchers to use generative AI ethically and responsibly. Research funding organizations are also advised to carefully consider the quality, transparency, integrity, and data protection aspects of generative AI tools when choosing which tools to use in their activities.


### Internal processes

The guidelines emphasize that research funding organizations should review their internal processes transparently and responsibly when using generative AI. This means that these organizations should ensure that the use of generative AI is accountable and human oversight is maintained throughout the process. They should also consider the quality, transparency, integrity, data protection, confidentiality, and respect for intellectual property rights when choosing generative AI tools for their activities.

Research funding organizations are expected to remain fully responsible for the use of generative AI in their activities. This includes using generative AI transparently, especially in activities related to the management of assessment and evaluation processes. It is crucial for these organizations to ensure that the content and the fairness of the process are not compromised when utilizing generative AI tools. Additionally, they should carefully consider the limitations of the technology and tools, providing feedback and recommendations to their researchers accordingly.


### Transparency from applicants

Research funding organizations, as recommended by the European Research Area Forum, should ensure that they remain fully responsible for the use of generative AI in their internal processes. This means that they must use generative AI transparently, especially in activities related to the management of assessment and evaluation purposes, without compromising the confidentiality of the content and the fairness of the process. When choosing generative AI tools, these organizations should carefully consider factors such as quality, transparency, integrity, data protection, confidentiality, and respect for intellectual property rights.

Furthermore, research funding organizations are advised to use generative AI tools in a manner that aligns with existing national, EU, and international legislation, particularly when it comes to sensitive activities like peer reviews or evaluations. It is crucial for these organizations to respect applicable laws and regulations, especially concerning the protection of intellectual property rights and personal data. By ensuring that generative AI is used responsibly and ethically, research funding organizations can contribute to maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the research process.


### Watch

The guidelines developed by the European Research Area Forum for Research Funding Organizations emphasize the importance of actively monitoring and engaging with the evolving landscape of generative AI. This involves staying informed about the latest developments in generative AI technology and understanding how it is being used within research activities. Research funding organizations are encouraged to analyze the limitations of generative AI tools, provide feedback to researchers, and offer recommendations to ensure responsible and ethical use of these tools.

Furthermore, the guidelines highlight the need for research funding organizations to carefully consider the adherence of generative AI tools to standards of quality, transparency, integrity, data protection, confidentiality, and respect for intellectual property rights. It is essential for these organizations to select generative AI tools that align with these principles and to implement measures that safeguard the confidentiality of content and ensure fairness in the evaluation processes. By integrating these considerations into their practices, research funding organizations can contribute to the responsible and effective use of generative AI in research.
