# Introduction to the AI Innovation and Compliance Guide for Horizon Europe Projects

## Welcome to the AI Innovation and Compliance Guide

.. specifically designed for researchers and developers engaged in Horizon Europe-funded projects that incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI). This guide serves as a tentative resource to navigate the intricate landscape of AI development within the framework of Horizon Europe, ensuring that innovation aligns with the European Union's standards, regulations, and ethical considerations.

Horizon Europe, the EU's key funding programme for research and innovation, builds on the legacy of Horizon 2020. It aims to drive scientific excellence, foster innovation, and address global challenges, while upholding the values and regulations that define the European Research Area. The integration of AI technologies in Horizon Europe projects presents unique opportunities for advancement and societal benefit. 

However, it also necessitates careful consideration of ethical, legal, and social implications.

This guide is structured to provide clear and actionable insights into how your project can leverage AI technologies effectively and responsibly. It outlines the major texts, regulations, and recommendations that govern AI development in the EU context, including the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, the proposed AI Act, and relevant sections of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Key sections of this guide include:

Overview of EU AI Framework: An introduction to the EU's approach to AI, focusing on trustworthiness, ethical principles, and the balance between innovation and regulation.

* Compliance Checklist: A detailed checklist to help you ensure that your AI systems comply with EU regulations and recommendations, from data protection to algorithmic transparency and accountability.

* Innovation Best Practices: Strategies and methodologies for fostering innovation within the boundaries of ethical AI development, ensuring that your projects not only comply with EU standards but also lead in responsible AI advancements.

* Case Studies and Examples: Insights from successful Horizon Europe projects that have navigated the compliance landscape effectively, illustrating how regulatory adherence and innovation can go hand in hand.

* Resources and Tools: An assortment of tools, frameworks, and resources to assist you in the ethical design, development, and deployment of AI systems within your projects.

Our goal is to empower Horizon Europe project teams to excel in their AI endeavors, ensuring that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also ethically sound and compliant with EU regulations. By adhering to the principles and practices outlined in this guide, you will contribute to the EU's vision of a digital future that is safe, inclusive, and respects fundamental rights and values.

We invite you to utilize this guide as a roadmap for your AI-related projects under Horizon Europe, as we navigate the complexities of AI innovation together, towards a more resilient, digital Europe.
